### Bitcoin Install

View the [Extras](extras.md) page if you want to manually compile bitcoind.

Secure Socket Shell into your freenas server. SSH is a way to manage your server remotely over a network. When you don‚Äôt plug in a monitor & keyboard directly into the server, it‚Äôs called a ‚Äòheadless‚Äô server. The most popular SSH client is called [PuTTY, download it here](https://www.putty.org/). Connect to your FreeNAS‚Äô IP address, and log in with your root credentials.

```
# iocage list
```

You should see your bitcoin jail listed. Lets switch our console from our base system to our jail.

```
# iocage console bitcoin
```

You're in! Install `bitcoin-daemon`
```
# pkg install -y bitcoin-daemon bitcoin-utils nano
# sysrc bitcoind_enable="YES"
# cat <<EOT >> /usr/local/etc/bitcoind.conf
server=1
txindex=1
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
EOT
# nano /usr/local/etc/rc.d/bitcoind
```

In my case, because I use a different location to store the bitcoin data, I need to provide the data directory to the bitcoind service:

```
# sysrc bitcoind_data_dir="/mnt/bitcoin"
```

Change the pid file in the rc.d startup script. Remove the `#` comment before `pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"`

Save (Ctrl+O, ENTER) and exit (Ctrl+X)

Some apps, like `lnd`, look for the config file in the bitcoin data directory. It is FreeBSD tradition to keep config files in `/usr/local/etc`. So lets make a hard link so the config file exists in both spots. Changing one will change the other. Then start bitcoind and check sync progress:

```
# ln /usr/local/etc/bitcoind.conf /var/db/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
# service bitcoind start
# bitcoin-cli -datadir=/var/db/bitcoin getblockchaininfo
```

In my case, I need to use:
```
# bitcoin-cli -datadir=/mnt/bitcoin getblockchaininfo
```

Wait until sync is complete, once blocks=headers you're good to go. Let this run overnight.

Note: If the bitcoind service does not start it could be that the correct path for the bitcoin congig file is `/usr/local/etc/bitcoin.conf`. In this case the following commands need to be executed:

```
# cat <<EOT >> /usr/local/etc/bitcoin.conf
server=1
txindex=1
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
EOT
# rm /var/db/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
# ln /usr/local/etc/bitcoin.conf /var/db/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
# service bitcoind start
# bitcoin-cli -datadir=/var/db/bitcoin getblockchaininfo
```

### How to upgrade bitcoind: 
```
# service bitcoind stop
# pkg update && pkg upgrade bitcoin-daemon bitcoin-utils
# nano /usr/local/etc/rc.d/bitcoind
```
Remove the `#` comment before `pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"`

Save (Ctrl+O, ENTER) and exit (Ctrl+X)

Start bitcoin:
```
# service bitcoind start
```
